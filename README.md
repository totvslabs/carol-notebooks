# Carol-Notebooks
This is the Carol Notebooks repository.

This repository has all certified notebooks made by TOTVS LABS DE Team so end-users can enhance their platform workflows.

The notebooks mainly use [pyCarol](https://github.com/totvslabs/pyCarol) to reach TOTVS Carol APIs to perform specific actions on the platform.

The notebooks will always follow the [NotebookModel](./NotebookModel.ipynb).
